# Basketball Game Counter

I completed my solo project on Scrimba's JavaScript Fundamentals path - a basketball game counter application. This project demonstrates my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals including DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game state management.

## Project Overview

This basketball game counter allows users to track scores for two teams with increment buttons for different point values (1, 2, and 3 points). It's a practical application of the JavaScript concepts learned throughout the fundamentals course.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Vite (for development and build process)
